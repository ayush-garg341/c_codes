// The default constructor does not need to be explicitly defined. Even if we donâ€™t create it, the C++ compiler will call a default constructor and set data members to some junk values.

// Constructor is a special member function with the same name as of the class. It is used to initialize the objects of its class.

// It is automatically invoked.

// Do not have return types.

// We cannot refer to their address.
